# Hashtable

 This is an implementation of the hashtable data structure in JavaScript.

# Challenge

Implement a Hashtable with the methods add, get, contains, and hash.

## Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

# Approach & Efficiency

add() time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), 

get() time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), 

contains() time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), 

hash() time O (1) space O (1) time is a big O(1), 

## API

hash() : method takes a key as string (arg) and return a hashed key
add () : method to hash the key then add it to array as a node in linked list
get() : get an item from array of the hashtable
contains() : return true if the key exist and false if not
