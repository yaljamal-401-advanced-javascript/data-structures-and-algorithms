# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge
- Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.



## Approach & Efficiency
Time Complexity: O(n)
