## Challenge Summary

Find the first repeated word in a book.

## Challenge Description

Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

## Approach & Efficiency

* time: O(n)
