# depthFirst

Implement a `depthFirst` on a `graph`.

## Challenge

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
