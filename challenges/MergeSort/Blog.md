# Merge Sort

Using the the input array `[8,4,23,42,16,15]` , we will be going through the pseudo code below showing the output at each step.

``` JavaScript
{
    ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n < --arr.length

    if n > 1
    DECLARE mid < --n / 2
    DECLARE left < --arr[0...mid]
    DECLARE right < --arr[mid...n]
    // sort the left side
    Mergesort(left)
    // sort the right side
    Mergesort(right)
    // merge the sorted left and right sides together
    Merge(left, right, arr)

    ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i < --0
    DECLARE j < --0
    DECLARE k < --0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
    if left[i] <= right[j]
    arr[k] < --left[i]
    i < --i + 1
    else
        arr[k] < --right[j]
    j < --j + 1

    k < --k + 1

    if i = left.length
    set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
        set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left

}
```

### Step1:

* Divide the array in two arrays `left =[8,4,23]` , `right=[42,16,15]`
* Start by comparing `[4]` with `[8]` , and placing the two single element arrays back into a 2 element array with left= `[4,8]` , right = `[23]` We also compare `[42]` with `[16]` and move them back into 2 element array with left= `[16,42]` and right= `[15]` .

### Step2:

Compare the front element of each array, which ever array has the smaller value at this position moves its value into the original array and the counters for this array and the original array are incremented. In our case, on the left side we have to compare [4, 8] and [23], and on the right we have [16, 42] and [15]. These merge into [4, 8, 23] and [15, 16, 42].

### Step3:

Merge [4, 8, 23] and [15, 16, 42]. We merge these in the same process as the above step, starting at the head of the array and moving down.

### Step4:

return the sorted array of [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].
