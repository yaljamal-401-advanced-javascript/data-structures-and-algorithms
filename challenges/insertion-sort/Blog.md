# Insertion Sort

Using the the input array `[8,4,23,42,16,15]` , we will be going through the pseudo code below showing the output at each step.

``` JavaScript
{
    InsertionSort(int[] arr)

    FOR i = 1 to arr.length

    int j < --i - 1
    int temp < --arr[i]

    WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
    arr[j + 1] < --arr[j]
    j < --j - 1

    arr[j + 1] < --temp
}
```

### pass1: 

First we start with  (i= 1) and j=0, `temp=arr[1]=4` , and compare 'temp'  with the value in `arr[j]=8` .
`[4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]

### pass2:

Move forward to (i=2) and j=1. temp=23, temp is larger than the value at `arr[j]` , we immediately break out of the while loop.
The temp is now set in  arr[j + 1] and the output is array [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15].

### pass3:

Move forward to i=3 j=2. Set the temp to the value at `arr[3]= 42` .
like with step two, temp is larger than the value at `arr[2]` so we immediately break out of the while loop.
The temp is now set in the position arr[j + 1] and the output is array [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]

### pass4:

Move forward to i=4 and j=3. temp=16.
This time, we move through our while loop twice to move the element to the left 2 indices.
Once the while statement conditions fail, the temp will be set in the position [j + 1] and the output is array [4, 8, 16, 23, 42, 15].

### pass5:

Move forward to i=5 and j=4. temp=15.
Move through our while loop 3 times to move the element to the left 3 indices.
Once the while statement conditions fail, the temp will be set in the position [j + 1] and the final output is the sorted array [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]
